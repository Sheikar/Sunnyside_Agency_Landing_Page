- Flexbox

- CSS Grid

- Mobile-first workflow

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

General knowledge on how to use amd implement the html picture tag and srcsets. 

```html

 <picture class="picture">

   	<source media="(min-width: 600px)" srcset="./big/image.jpg">

    <source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="./small/image.jpg">

  	<img class="class" src="./general/source.png" alt="">

	</picture>

```

The css properties of adding and editing svg files was quite intriguing...

```css

.svg-selector:hover {

  cursor: pointer;

  filter: brightness(0) invert(1);

}

```

I was also able to grasp some info on responsive designing using some media queries...

### Continued development

I want to dive deeper using node, js and their frameworks like react and the likes...
